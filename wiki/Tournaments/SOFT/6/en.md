## Ruleset

### Tournament organisation

#### Round overview

- With the exception of the qualification stage (which does not have a winning condition), each tournament round will have a selectable mappool of a certain size, a tiebreaker song, and a winning condition. The format is as follows:
  - **Qualification Stage:** 4-song mappool, no winning condition, no tiebreaker song
  - **Playoff Stage and Group Stage:** 10-song mappool, best of 7 (first to 4), one tiebreaker song
  - **Round of 32 and Round of 16:** 12-song mappool, best of 9 (first to 5), one tiebreaker song
  - **Quarterfinals and Semifinals:** 14-song mappool, best of 11 (first to 6), one tiebreaker song
  - **Finals and Grand Finals:** 16-song mappool, best of 13 (first to 7), one tiebreaker song

#### Qualification process

- All players that enter the tournament will be eligible to play in the qualification round. However, the number of participants who will advance to the next round will be cut down to the nearest power of 2. **The maximum number of players who can advance to the subsequent round is 128.** The criterion used to determine whether a player will progress to the next round is their performance in the qualification stage.
  - If 32 players enter, all 32 players will qualify and no one gets eliminated.
  - If 33 players enter, the worst-performing player gets eliminated and the top 32 will advance to the next round.
  - If 49 players enter, the 17 worst-performing players get eliminated and the top 32 will advance to the next round.
  - If 63 players enter, the 31 worst-performing players get eliminated and the top 32 will advance to the next round.
  - If 64 players enter, all 64 players will qualify and no one gets eliminated.
  - If 127 players enter, the 63 worst-performing players get eliminated and the top 64 will advance to the next round.
- The qualification round will have a 4-song mappool that widely varies in skillsets tested. These tested skillsets will correspond to skillsets commonly seen in mappools throughout the tournament.
- **All four maps will be created by the mappool selectors and will be unreleased prior to the tournament qualification stage, to provide 0 opportunity for advantage through familiarity.**
- All players will play the qualifier maps in the designated stage order. Every player needs to play each map fully at least once to be considered a valid participant.
- All players will have two chances at each qualifier map, in which the highest of the two runs on each qualifier map will be used to calculate their final score.
- Regardless of the number of entrants and eliminations, the qualification process will also be done to seed players. Players will be ordered based on their average score rating on all four songs, with the best average score rating being seed \#1.
- We will be using **Score V2** for all rounds of the tournament.

#### Post-qualification

- The round after the qualification stage (also known as Playoff Stage) is a **single elimination** stage with specific rules.
- After the qualification round, the remaining players will be divided into 4 different groups based on their qualification seeds. Each group will have a different set of protocols to follow.
  - **1st-16th seeds**: The top 16 seeds of the qualification stage will advance directly into Group Stage of the tournament. They do not need to participate in any matches during Playoff Stage.
  - **17th-32nd seeds**: Players within this group will participate in one match during Playoff Stage. Their opponent will be a player from the 97th-128th seed group. Players who win their matches in this stage will advance to Group Stage.
  - **33rd-96th seeds**: Players within this group will participate in one match during Playoff Stage. Their opponent will be a player in the 33rd to 96th seed group — more specifically, `(129 - the player's seed)`. Players who win their match in this stage will advance to Group Stage.
  - **97th-128th seeds**: Players within this group will participate in **two matches** during Playoff Stage. Their first opponent will be a player in the 97th-128th seed group — more specifically, `(225 - the player's seed)`. If the player wins their first match, their second opponent will be a player in the 17th-32nd seed group. Players who win both of their matches in this stage will advance to Group Stage.

#### Group stage

- After Playoff Stage, the remaining players will be divided into 4 different groups based on their qualification seed. These groups will be labelled "Top Seed", "High Seed", "Low Seed", and "Bottom Seed". Groups (for Group Stage) are then formed by randomly selecting one player from each seed group.
- Group Stage will consist of **two (2) rounds**. In the **first round** of Group Stage, there will be 2 matches per group.
  - The first match is a match between the Top Seed and High Seed. The winner of this match will advance to the Bracket Stage. The loser of this match will play in the second round of Group Stage.
  - The second match is a match between the Bottom seed and Low seed. The winner of this match will get to play in the second round of Group Stage. The loser of this match will be eliminated from the tournament.
- In the **second round** of Group Stage, the loser of the first match and the winner of the second match will face each other. The winner of this match will advance to the Bracket Stage. The loser will be eliminated.

#### Bracket stage

- The Bracket Stage is a **double elimination** stage. Players advancing to this stage must lose two matches in this stage to be eliminated from the tournament.
- After Group Stage, the remaining players will be seeded based on their performance in Group Stage. This will be used to determine the remaining players' opponents for the bracket stage. In particular, their opponent for the bracket stage will be `(33 - the player's GS seed)`.
- In a winners bracket match, the player who meets the winning condition in a match will be declared the winner of the match and will move further into the bracket. The loser of the match will fall into the losers bracket.
- In a losers bracket match, the player who meets the winning condition in a match will be declared the winner of the match and will move further into the bracket. The loser of the match will be eliminated from the tournament.
- Players who are in the winners bracket are required to play in one match in each stage. The only exception to this is if the player is the sole player in winner bracket in the Grand Finals stage, where the player is required to play in up to two matches if the player were to lose their first match in the Grand Finals stage.
- Players who are in the losers bracket at the start of the Quarterfinals or further are required to play in two matches in a single stage. However, players who lose their first match in the losers bracket in those stages will no longer need to play in any further matches, for they are eliminated from the tournament.

### Tournament play

#### Protocol

- Overlaps between matches may happen in certain stages. As a result, streaming every match is not viable. Tournament staff will do their best to give every player in the tourney some stream time.
- Your matches will be listed in schedules. **It is your duty as a player to properly identify your timeslot and reschedule your match with your opponent as soon as possible if a reschedule is necessary.**
- Reschedules will only be considered if both players agree to a time. This needs to be done and notified to the tournament staff before **Wednesday at 23:59 UTC+0** during the particular week when your match takes place.
- ***It is your right as a player and tournament entrant to expect that staff will perform to the best of their abilities in moderating matches in such a way that they will conclude in a timely manner.***
  - Rooms with matches will be created before the match start time, and you will be invited to the corresponding tournament room before the match start time.
  - For maximal accountability on the SOFT6 staff, each match will have a primary referee and a backup referee. That way, you will be assured that someone will be present to handle your tournament match.
  - If both players arrive on time, tournament proceedings will begin promptly at the start time of the match, **no earlier and no later.**
  - If your match starts in less than five (5) minutes and you have not been invited to your corresponding multiplayer room, notify any Tournament Staff member who is online on Discord or in-game that you are a player in SOFT6 and you currently do not have an invitation to your match. They will alleviate the situation by notifying the designated referees for your match to give you an invitation to your corresponding multiplayer room.
- ***It is our right as tournament staff to expect that you will arrive for your matches before your expected time.***
  - Players will be given a grace period of ten (10) minutes after the match start time to enter their room. If they have not entered by this point, the match will be forfeited and the player that has arrived will win by default. However, exceptions will be given to players who were late due to technical issues/staff impropriety.
    - **Players who enter the room during the grace period cannot select a warm-up for the match.**
  - In the extreme circumstance where both players do not show, **the player with the higher group stage seed in the match-up will advance automatically**. During Playoff Stage, **the player with the higher qualifier seed in the match-up will advance automatically**.
- ***It is your privilege as a player and tournament entrant to have an opinion about the content/structure used in the tournament.***
  - You are experiencing this event as a competitor and every choice made in the process directly affects how you will progress in the tournament.
  - If you dislike something, you are allowed to state your concerns. However, do so reasonably. Keep in mind that some of your fellow competitors and other users on this website have content that will inevitably be used in the tournament, and it is best advised that you make it clear that it is your opinion so as to not be hurtful.
- ***It is our right as the SOFT6 staff to reprimand users for intolerable behaviour.***
  - SOFT6 staff will have sole discretion over decisions that affect a player's standing in the tournament. However, other members of the tournament may forward any information to staff members that in any way represents uncalled-for behaviour towards other users or staff. Staff members will attempt to escalate serious situations beyond the scope of this event if need be, so please be respectful to other users and staff.
  - Minor instances will receive warnings, and continued instances will result in forceful removal from the tournament.

#### Warm-up songs

- Each player in the match will be allowed one (1) warm-up song to be played. All warm-up songs must be osu!mania 4K specific beatmaps.
- The warm-up must be uploaded to the osu! website and accessible by everyone prior to the tournament match. Links to beatmap mirrors or other file hosts are **not allowed**.
- Maps that have a beatmap listing but cannot be downloaded are not allowed for the purpose of warming up. If a map takes too long to download, the referee may decide to skip the warm-up instead.
- Before Bracket Stage, player warm-up songs cannot exceed a drain time of three (3) minutes. During Bracket Stage, player warmup songs cannot exceed a drain time of four (4) minutes.
- Warm-up songs will be on FreeMod, which allows for any special modifications that players see fit for the purpose of warming up properly. If agreed upon by both players, warm-up songs can be played with DT or HT so long as their drain time does not exceed the corresponding limits.

#### Bans, protects, rolls, and song selection

- With the exception of warm-ups, all songs played in a given round must match those that are selectable in the corresponding mappool. Maps are to be played on a restrictive FreeMod: only Mirror, Hidden, Fade In, Flashlight, and NoFail can be used.
- Players are to protect one (1) map from being banned within the mappool that they are playing for the given round.
- Players are to ban one (1) map within the mappool that they are playing for the given round.
- Players will be instructed to do a `!roll` command by the referee that is overseeing the match. The player with the winning roll decides whether they want to protect, ban, and pick first or second.
- After the protects, bans, and rolls have concluded, the player with first pick instructs the referee of their song selection, and the referee will switch to that song. After that song concludes, the other player will pick a song, and this process will continue until one of two conditions is satisfied:
  1. One player has achieved enough wins in such a way that the other player cannot successfully win the round.
     - The winning player moves onto the next match.
     - The losing player falls to the losers bracket. If the losing player loses while in the loser's bracket, they are eliminated from the tournament.
  2. Both players are at match point at the same time.
     - Both players will play the song designated as the tiebreaker.
     - The winner of the tiebreaker will progress to the next match of the tournament, while the loser will be eliminated or sent to the loser's bracket, depending on their position in the tournament.
- Players will have 2 minutes to pick a map and 2 minutes to get ready.
  - In the event of a player taking more than 2 minutes to select a map, they will receive a warning from the designated referee. Subsequent occurrences will result in the designated referee picking a random map available to be picked within the mappool using `!roll X`, where X is the number of selectable maps remaining in the mappool.
  - Each player will receive a "tactical timeout" of **two minutes**, which can be used at any time during their own pick, **once per match**. *The tactical timeout is optional, and is not required to be used.* **Tactical timeouts cannot be used during the tiebreaker song.** There will be a fixed 3-minute period for both players to utilise during this stage provided by the staff of the tournament.
- If the beatmap ends in a draw, the game will be nullified and the beatmap will be replayed.

#### Disconnections

- Maps with a player disconnection that occurs within the first 30 seconds, or 25% of the song (whichever comes first) will be nullified and re-attempted.
- Matches will have a two-disconnection limit. Upon the third disconnection, a point will be handed immediately to the player still active within the lobby.
- A two-minute timer will be placed on a disconnected player when the song played has concluded. When this timer hits 0, the grace period mentioned in the [Protocol](#protocol) will be (re)activated. If the grace period timer hits 0, the match is forfeited, and the other remaining player will be declared the winner.
- Situations with two player disconnections will be executed similarly to two missing players for a given match: the higher seed will be declared the winner if both players have no time left in their grace period.
