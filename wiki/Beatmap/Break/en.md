# Break

**Breaks** are sections of a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) which have no [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_object). During this time, [health drain](/wiki/Beatmapping/Health_drain) is temporarily halted. Breaks usually allow the player to rest their arm for a short while and reposition their [input device](/wiki/Gameplay/Input_device).

Depending on the enabled [settings](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor/Song_Setup), letterboxes may appear when a break is initiated. In addition to this, a passing or failing graphic and sound may appear to indicate if a player is doing well or not. This will only appear if there is enough time for the graphic to show.
