# Guest difficulty

*For regulations surrounding guest difficulties, see: [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria)*

A **guest difficulty**, or *GD* for short, is a [difficulty](/wiki/Beatmap/Difficulty) of a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) that is not created by the [beatmap host](/wiki/Beatmap/Beatmap_host). It can usually be identified by its difficulty name containing the guest mapper's username.

Although not mandatory, having guest difficulties can be beneficial in many occasions as they often feature completely different mapping styles between one another, which diversifies the mapset, and helps reduce mapping burnout. Guest difficulties are most commonly requested through private messages between mappers, although they may also be requested by other means such as the in-game `#mapping` channel or [modding queues](/wiki/Community/Forum/Modding_Queues).

Guest difficulties are not to be confused with difficulties that feature multiple mappers, which are instead known as [collabs](/wiki/Beatmap/Beatmap_collaborations).

## Ownership

:::

On the [beatmap discussion page](/wiki/Beatmap_discussion), the beatmap host may transfer ownership of guest difficulties to their respective mappers through the `Difficulty Owner` button. This allows for the guest difficulty owners to resolve pending issues in their difficulties on their own.

Ownership of a guest difficulty cannot be changed if the beatmap is [Qualified](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#qualified), [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked), or [Loved](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#loved).
